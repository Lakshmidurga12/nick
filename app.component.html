<h2>THE INCREDIBLE LIFE AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF NICK VUJICIC</h2>
<div class="text">
<pre>
  “Take him away, I don’t want to see him!’’ Nicholas’s mum yelled after the disappointing 
  
  surprise she just encountered in the delivery room. It was a devastating experience to 
  have carried her baby, Nick Vujicic, in her womb peacefully for 9 months and then
   suddenly give birth to a physically challenged baby. That’s weird, isn’t it?

She had loved him from the womb even before laying her eyes on him, unfortunately,
 she was caught between the surging emotions of worry, concern and fear of what life held for him.

  <strong>
  Nicholas Vujicic was born to Dušanka and Borislav Vujičić in Melbourne, Australia on the 4th of December, 1982. He had phocomelia, no limbs. It wasn’t genetic and it wasn’t as a result of thalidomide. The ultrasound showed nothing negative. There was just no medical explanation for it.

In school, he was the first disabled child to be integrated into the Australian school system. He was bullied from pillar to post. He was laughed at, avoided and excluded from games. His fears soared by each passing day.

He attended Runcorn State High School, Queensland, Australia, where he played the role of the head boy and was also part of the student council that does humanitarian works and fundraising events for charities and disability campaigns locally.

At age 6, Nick tried some prosthetics but they were more of a constraint than aid because they limited his movement. Apparently, he had learnt how to do some things without them. No extra weight!
